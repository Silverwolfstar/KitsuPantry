<!--
Consider:
    - Options:
        - Delete button on edit page
        - Turn off date added, if implemented
        - Auto-combine duplicate options instead of warning.
        - Add units (g, cups, lbs, etc), or leave off for default items-only
    - Edit:
        - Exp date: Add a (?) button that displays recommended guesses.
            - And maybe an option to turn that off too.
            - Else maybe put it into the help menu?
    - Title: Kitsupantry instead of location.
    - Add page:
        - Date added (or edited)
    - Chaos mode? üòè
        - Whatever that means..
    - Paid/Premium options:
        - Extra theme selection.
        - Change highlight color of expiring soon/expired items.
